# A hash # character in Python denotes a comment
# Each comment in a newline must begin with a hash #
# It explains the code in the following lines ####
# A hash # can effectively comment out code. For example
print "This will print" #This of course, will print and the comment after will be ignored even if it wraps into the second line....
# print "this will not print" #But Of Course

# What combinations of single and double quotes work?
